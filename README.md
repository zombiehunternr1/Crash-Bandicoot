# Crash Bandicoot
 Trying to recreate Crash Bandicoot in Unity.
 
 This is a private project for hobby use only.
 I'm not trying to make any profit of this, just practicing my Unity skills while recreating one of my favorite childhood video game series.
 Since I've recently played Crash 4 - It's About Time I've also concidered using some mechanics from that game as well into my own project.
